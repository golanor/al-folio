I have a masters in physics from Tel Aviv University (under the supervision of [Prof. Eran Sela](https://www3.tau.ac.il/eransela/index.php)), in which I studied topological phases of matter. During my studies, I also worked as a data scientist at [SimilarWeb](https://www.similarweb.com/). After graduating, I worked for 9 months on a start up called [Manto](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/manto-ai), which did not survive. After that, I returned to SimilarWeb, and worked full time as a data scientist, until I joined [Qedma](www.qedma.com) on November 2020.

Today, I work as a quantum scientist, studying problems related to quantum computing, as well as doing general programming.
